# Installation
If you want a static version of Roblokis then follow below!  
(This might allow you to have early access to features before releasing.)

**NOTE:** The extension only works on chromium and mozilla based browsers.

Side Notes:
- Using it like that won't get you updates, you will have to redo this every time the extension gets updated
- You might get an annoying popup every time you open the browser

### Steps (Chromium Browsers):
1. Download this repository by pressing on "Code" (at top right)  
then pressing on "Download ZIP" and extract the file (location doesn't matter)
2. Go to your browser's extension tab a.k.a. Extension Manager
3. Turn on Developer Mode
4. Click "Load Unpacked"
5. Select the extension folder
6. Find Roblokis in Extension Manager and disable it  
(This removes the conflict between the original extension)

#### Removing Steps:
1. Go to your Browser's extension tab a.k.a. Extension Manager (turn on Developer Mode if not on already)
2. Remove Roblokis extension with a mark on it
3. Turn on the original Roblokis
4. (Optional) remove the extracted folder
